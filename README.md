# README

All projects can be divided into three parts, mainly,

#### Setup



1. Backend (src/main/java) 

   - Build **Java Springboot** Enviroment
   - Build **Maven** to manage the jar package

2. Frontend (src/main/resources/static)

   - Build **npm** to use the webpack for package management. 

     **p.s.** Almost all packages used are attached in the project, this is probably used for re-development, *If you just want to use this demo, ignore it*.

   - Make you are connected to the internet to use several **cdn** js packages

3. Database (sql.txt)

   - run the **sql script** to build the database

   **p.s.** If you are not familiar with the command line, just copy&paste to run in your IDE

   **p.s.** If you want other detailed configurations that I applied on this demo (mostly for security consideration) , please feel free to contact me



#### Run

If you have setup the project correctly, just run the java code and test the demo on **localhost:8080/login.html**
